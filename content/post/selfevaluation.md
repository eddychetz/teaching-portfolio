Assessment of my own work is a great deal as this opens up room for adjustments where necessary. Teaching and learning is continuous process for both students and the instructor. I have realized a lot in my teaching and learning journey and discovered that it takes two to achieve something great in the process.  Assessment of students is crucial in terms of determining the level of understanding of the content delivered during class sessions.

Your input determines your level of understanding thus giving me a heads up on how much you need assistance as a student.

These topics help me to adjust my teaching strategy in the future and give me a signal to address them in the weekly assessment review sessions. Overall results of an assessment also help in identifying students at risk and action is taken to assist the identified students such remedial sessions as well as assigning them to the active learner to be assisted during their study sessions.
