### _Being Part of and Participating in the Academic Community_

Contributing to curriculum development so as to structure it in a way that brings integrated thinking approach at their fingertips. As a member of teaching and learning committee and other faculty members take a stance to influence the decisions regarding curriculum. 

The recent discussion made with the teaching and learning committee was to make necessary adjustments in the current curriculum. This gave me the opportunity to actively participate in the academic community by proposing changes of End-User Computing course content for diplomas to Basic Statistics to prepare students for Data analysis career paths.
