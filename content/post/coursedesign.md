### _Ability to cover content that make students industrial-ready as they leave college_.

This section outlines the designing process of the modules that are part of the Data Science cluster. Applied Mathematics 1781/281 and Machine Learning 381-2 are the courses that will be used in this portfolio. Each module is given 16 hours per week of contact time with the subject matter expert (4-hour lesson with a 15 minute break after every 2 hours).

Initially, the Applied Mathematics 121 (now Applied Mathematics 281) module was designed in such a way that it transforms first year students into tertiary education environment and equipped them with basic understanding of advanced algebra, functions, vectors and matrices among other concepts. These topics connects the student with the system, enabling the understanding of foundation concepts to a Data Science career. This is a five-credit semester module.

Successful completion of this 2nd year module is based on the grading scale of 30% CA and 70% of a 2-hours proctored EXAM written at the end of quarter in which the module is being offered. This is normally 1st quarter as it is a pre-requisite to other modules such As Machine Learning 381. Outcomes of this module are covered within a period of 3 weeks. A student is required to submit 3 individual assignments, and to write 3 continuous assessment tests every last day of the week that is 2 formative assessments and one summative assessment at the end. These test will be proctored in a customized, monitored online environment. This only leave the student with approx. 16 hours per week of contact time with the subject matter expert.

Machine learning 381 module is designed to give the student foundation to Machine learning concepts (Regression, classification, and clustering topics for supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms). This module spans up to 2 weeks duration with 2 proctored, weekly tests and 1 project. This is also a five-credit semester module. The module prepares the student for Machine Learning 382 practical module to which the student is expected to apply the foundation concepts of Machine Learning 381, Python and/or R programming skills from other modules of the program and Mathematics 281 concepts to some real-world data sets.
